# mektondesigns

I designed this repo for the sole purpose of practicing python and vim. These designs are based on the rulesets created by R. Talsorian Games: Mekton Zeta, Mekton Zeta Plus. I've also used source material from Palladium Books Robotech series and Macross II. Why Macross? I've always been a fan of Shoji Kawamori's mecha designs, space combat and the earlier work of the Macross Universe story.
